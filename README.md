# How To Desagree? - Contradiction Detection Project 

## About the Project

The aim of the project is to build a model able to predict contradictions in text, which has been identified as one of the 7 different types of arguments used in conversation and disputes according to Paul Graham in its essay. Contradiction detection is one of the biggest challenges in natural language processing considering especially the wide range of types of contradiction a conversation can face. The solution has been written through Python 3 using Google Colab. Two approaches have been implemented to the problem trying to recognize patterns in sentences. The first approach is based on extracting some features that could lead to identify contradictions in text, while the second one will make use of Word2Vec sentence encoders to try capturing information in the sentences leading to contradiction identification.

## About the Dataset

The dataset has been taken from Kaggle, named "Contradictory, My Dear Watson", consisting into premise-hypothesis pairs in fifteen different languages, labeled by three categories: entailment (0), neutral(1) or contradiction(2). The dataset is available at: ```https://www.kaggle.com/c/contradictory-my-dear-watson```.
